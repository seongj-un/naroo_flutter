# Naroo Beta Deployment Strategy

This document defines the minimum deployment strategy for a private Naroo beta.

## Goal

Naroo beta needs a private web link that 5-10 target students can open from their phones.

The deployment should support:

- Spring Boot/Kotlin backend
- Social login
- MySQL
- HTTPS
- Environment variables
- Private beta access

## Deployment Shape

Use a simple single-service deployment:

```text
Student browser
  -> HTTPS web app
  -> Spring Boot app
  -> MySQL
  -> OAuth provider
```

For beta, avoid Kubernetes, multi-service architecture, queues, or custom infrastructure.

## Runtime Target

The hosted service must support:

- Java 17
- Gradle build
- Spring Boot application startup
- HTTPS endpoint
- Environment variables
- Health check endpoint

Recommended app command pattern:

```text
./gradlew bootJar
java -jar build/libs/naroo-*.jar
```

The exact platform can be chosen later as long as it supports the runtime target above.

## Database Target

Use managed MySQL for beta.

Required settings:

- One production database
- One local/dev database
- Connection string provided through environment variables
- SSL enabled in hosted environment
- Daily backups if the provider supports them

Do not use in-memory storage for external beta, because next-day return and saved progress are success criteria.

## Required Environment Variables

```text
SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod
DATABASE_URL=<mysql connection string>
OAUTH_PROVIDER=<google|kakao>
OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=<provider client id>
OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=<provider client secret>
APP_BASE_URL=https://<private-beta-domain>
SESSION_SECRET=<random secret>
```

If the selected OAuth provider needs provider-specific variables, keep them prefixed:

```text
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=...
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=...
KAKAO_CLIENT_ID=...
KAKAO_CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

## OAuth Redirect URLs

For local development:

```text
http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/<provider>
```

For private beta:

```text
https://<private-beta-domain>/login/oauth2/code/<provider>
```

The OAuth app configuration must include both local and beta redirect URLs before external testing.

## Profiles

Use at least two Spring profiles:

```text
local
prod
```

Local profile:

- Local MySQL or test container
- Local OAuth redirect URL
- Debug-friendly logging

Prod profile:

- Hosted MySQL
- HTTPS base URL
- Secure cookies
- No debug logs with student data

## Secrets Rules

- Never commit OAuth secrets.
- Never commit database URLs.
- Never print access tokens in logs.
- Never log raw OAuth profile payloads.
- Never store student real names unless the product needs them.

## Beta Access

For the first beta, keep access private:

- Share the link manually.
- Do not index the app publicly.
- Do not add public marketing pages yet.
- Keep the first page task-focused: start diagnostic or continue progress.

## Health Check

Add a simple health endpoint before deployment:

```text
GET /actuator/health
```

It should verify app startup. Database readiness can be added once persistence is implemented.

## Release Checklist

Before sharing the link:

- App starts with `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod`.
- Database connection works.
- OAuth login works on the hosted URL.
- New social login creates one student account.
- Returning social login reuses the same account.
- Diagnostic attempt persists.
- Result can be reloaded after closing the browser.
- Behavior events are recorded for diagnostic start, diagnostic completion, result view, recovery start, hint request, unknown answer, recovery completion, next mission preview, and next-day return.
- Mobile 375px layout works.
- Error states do not expose stack traces.

## Staged Rollout

Do not send the first beta link to all testers at once.

Use this rollout:

```text
1. Founder self-test
   - Complete login
   - Complete diagnostic
   - View result
   - Start recovery mission
   - Complete recovery mission
   - Return after closing browser

2. One trusted student
   - Watch for OAuth, mobile layout, and confusing copy issues
   - Fix obvious blockers before inviting more people

3. Three students
   - Confirm diagnostic completion and recovery start events are recorded
   - Check whether anyone drops between result and recovery mission

4. Ten students
   - Run the full private beta only after the first three steps pass
```

Rollback rule:

If login, diagnostic completion, result view, or recovery start breaks for any tester, pause invitations and fix before adding more students.

## Beta Observability

Record behavior events for the first beta. These events are product learning data, not analytics vanity metrics.

Required events:

```text
diagnostic_started
diagnostic_completed
result_viewed
recovery_started
hint_requested
unknown_selected
recovery_completed
next_mission_preview_viewed
next_day_returned
```

Each event should include:

```text
student_id
attempt_id
question_set_version
mission_id
created_at
```

Do not include email, access tokens, raw OAuth profile payloads, or free-form student notes in behavior events.

Minimum beta dashboard questions:

- How many students started the diagnostic?
- How many completed it?
- How many viewed the result?
- How many started the first recovery mission?
- How many completed the first recovery mission?
- How many returned the next day?

## Not In Scope For Beta Deployment

- Kubernetes
- Multi-region deployment
- CDN tuning
- Automated blue/green deployment
- Public landing page
- Payment system
- School/teacher admin portal

## Open Decisions

- OAuth provider: Google, Kakao, or both.
- Hosting provider.
- MySQL provider.
- Private beta domain or temporary provider URL.

Make these decisions before inviting external testers.
